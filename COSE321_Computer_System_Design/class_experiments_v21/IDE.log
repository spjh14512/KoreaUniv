2. Non JTAG bootmode - Bootrom may need time to enable DAP.
Please try again.


Troubleshooting hints:
1. Check whether board is connected to system properly.
2. In case of zynq board, check whether Digilent/Xilinx cable switch settings are correct.
3. If you are using Xilinx Platform Cable USB, ensure that status LED is green.
